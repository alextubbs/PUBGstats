The data is player statistics in PUBG which were retrieved from Kaggle. It belongs to JustinMoore and the PUBG game. The data can be found here:

I found a dataset on players in the popular videogame, PUBG, or Player Unknown Battlegrounds. This is a first-person shooter video game, where players are dropped onto an island with nothing, and must scavenge for supplies to survive and kill other players. They also must stay inside a designated area, which slowly shrinks to draw players closer together, so some players must move incredible distances to stay in the game.

In PUBG, one can play solo, as a duo, or in a team of four. The data set had stats for all three versions of the game,  but for this project, I chose to look specifically at player stats when playing solo, since I thought a team setting may have more uncontrollable variables that I would not be able to account for, like how well their teammates do, which could affect the wins and ranking.

In this project I am attempting to predict a playerâ€™s solo ranking based on their statistics in the game. All variables are continuous, so I will be doing a regular linear regression. 


The code is an R-markdown file, so R is required to run the file.
